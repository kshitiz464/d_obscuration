# Drone Swarm Simulation Development Workflow

## Project Goal
To develop a 3D drone swarm simulation capable of:
1.  Forming specific patterns (rectangular, staggered).
2.  Navigating from arbitrary initial positions.
3.  Hovering stably around target positions.
4.  Avoiding collisions.
5.  Operating under realistic, variable wind conditions.
6.  Being structured for future AI/ML model training.
7.  Visualizing the entire simulation trajectory.
8.  Counting collisions.
